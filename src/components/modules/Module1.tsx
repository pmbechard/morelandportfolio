        How can the Edpuzzle you completed in the previous assignment guide you
        as you progress through this program?

        The Edpuzzle provided an overview of the key components of the TEACH-NOW
        platform and laid out the expectations for students. It will be a useful
        resource to return to if I'm ever feeling lost or uncertain while
        navigating the platform throughout this program.
