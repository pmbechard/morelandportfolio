        How can the Edpuzzle you completed in the previous assignment guide you
        as you progress through this program?
      </h2>
      <p>
        <Tab />
        The Edpuzzle provided an overview of the key components of the TEACH-NOW
        platform and important resources for students, including an outline of
        student expectations. It will be a useful visual resource to return to
        if I'm ever feeling lost or uncertain while navigating the platform or
        have general questions about the program.

      <h2>
        How can the information you discovered in the Course Catalog and
        Candidate Handbook guide you as you progress through this program?
      </h2>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Course Catalog and Candidate Handbook
        provides general information about Moreland, specific information about
        academic programs and policies, and other crucial information such as
        calendars, admissions, rights, and policies and procdures. For me, this
        will be specifically useful, not only for all of the necessary
        information it provides to students of the program, but also because I
        plan to do more exploring of the MEd program with a focus on Educational
        Technology as a future option. Many of the question I have about this
        program, and other commonplace questions that will inevitably arise,
        will be answered here.

      <h2>
        How can the InTASC Standards and Clinical Rubric guide you as you
        progress through this program?
      </h2>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The InTASC Standards and Clinical Rubric will be
        essential guides as I begin to implement knowledge and skills gained in
        the program into the classroom.
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The InTASC standards (1) set out clear
        expectations for what skills the participant should expect to take away
        from their time in the TEACH-NOW program as a successful teacher and (2)
        what the teacher should consistently consider and be able to demonstrate
        in their practice. These standards will serve as a guide for my
        learning, growth, and application of skills throughout the program and
        in the classroom.
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Clinical Rubrics takes the InTASC standards
        and puts them into a measurable form that can be used for assessment.
        These criteria will help me to evaluate my own planning and
        implementations in the classroom and help to ensure that I am meeting
        the expectations set out by the InTASC standards.
